# 416. Partition Equal Subset Sum

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` *if you can partition the array into two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal or* `false` *otherwise.*

## Complexity

- Time Complexity: `O(n * targetSum)`
- Space Complexity: `O(targetSum)`
