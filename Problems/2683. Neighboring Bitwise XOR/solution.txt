# Intuition
For the cyclic condition to hold (original[n−1] ⊕ original[0] = derived[n−1]), the total sum of the derived array must be even.
If it's odd, it's impossible to satisfy the cyclic XOR condition.

# Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

# Code
```c []
bool doesValidArrayExist(int* derived, int derivedSize) {
    
    int sum = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < derivedSize; i++){
        sum = derived[i] ^ sum;
    }

    if (sum == 0) return true;
    else return false;
}
```
